# Proxify

**Proxify** is a VERY simple proxy using PHP and cURL.

## How can I change the configuration?

Easy, edit the file called `config.php` and that's it.

## How to start the development server

If you want to try the proxy, you can use the script.

```shell
./proxify start
```

## How can I clean the cache directory?

You can use the clean script.

**NOTE**: This will also remove the cookie file

```shell
./proxify clean
```

## Configuration

The file `config.php` contains every configuration parameter
and also has a complete description of every parameter.

## Is this production ready?

OF COURSE NOT! This is an experiment, a personal project I made some time ago
and this is NOT production ready.
